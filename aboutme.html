<p>Hi World, I'm Natia Davis, currently studying Grahpic Design at Miami International University of Art and Design. I am currently in my fifth quarter at Ai Miami and I find it to be very interesting!
Since beginning the process of learning Graphic Design I have acquired a lot of skill in Adobe Photoshop. I'm looking forward to learning other Adobe programs suchs as Illustrator and InDesign.
