        <h1>Urban Decay</h1>
        <p>Urban Decay is beauty with an edge. Feminine, dangerous and fun, it appeals to women who relish their individuality and dare to express it. From our insane range of velvety Eyeshadows—including the bestselling (and often-copied) Naked Palettes—to our award-winning eye liners, budge-proof mascaras and legendary Makeup Setting Sprays, we've been shaking up the industry for over 15 years.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitments</h2>
        <p>Urban Decay has always stood for the empowerment of women—from the products we create to the causes we support. When we launched in 1996, the prestige beauty market was a sea of pink, red and beige. We gave women the alternative makeup colors they craved and challenged them to defy the stereotypical notions of beauty. But it doesn't end with makeup. Urban Decay announces the launch of The Ultraviolet Edge, our global initiative to empower women. By supporting organizations that fight for the rights of women everywhere, we encourage all women to embrace their individuality in everything they do. To us, that's the definition of beauty with an edge™. </p>
